# Summary

In Africa, growing investment in infrastructure, data, and networks has created momentum 
to harness genomics to address local and global health challenges, biodiversity, and development. 
However, achieving this potential requires coordinated efforts to build research capacity, 
ensure equitable data generation and access, and strengthen African leadership across the 
genomics ecosystem.

This inaugural short course is a flagship collaboration between the **African Society of Human Genetics (AfSHG)**, 
the **University of Cape Town (UCT)**, faculty members from African universities, **Wellcome Connecting Science**, 
**The Jackson Laboratory**, **John Hopkins University** and a growing network of regional and global partners committed 
to advancing genomics in Africa. Designed to reflect the continent’s pivotal role in the history and future of genomics, 
this intensive 10-day residential course brings together early and mid-career researchers from across Africa to build 
interdisciplinary knowledge, strengthen practical skills, and develop leadership capacity to advance genomics research. 
Participants will critically explore foundational and emerging topics in genomics, engage in hands-on analysis using 
accessible tools and datasets, and examine case studies rooted in African-led initiatives. The course will also highlight 
ethical research practices, with a focus on local and global contexts and how research can be applied equitably.

Through practical sessions, expert-led seminars, peer exchange, and project-based learning, 
the course will also provide a platform to strengthen networks, nurture innovation, and support 
participants to become catalysts for sustainable capacity development in their home institutions and countries.

## Target audience
This course is aimed at researchers and clinical professionals based in Africa who are actively engaged in genomics, 
bioinformatics, or closely related fields. It is particularly suited for **early to mid-career scientists**, including 
**advanced PhD students**, **postdoctoral researchers**, and **healthcare professionals** (e.g. clinicians, genetic counsellors, 
lab scientists) contributing to genomics research or its application in healthcare. Ideal candidates will have some 
hands-on experience in generating or analysing genomic data, and a demonstrated commitment to strengthening research 
and training capacity within their institutions or regions.

## Learning outcomes
**By the end of the course, participants will be able to:**
- Critically evaluate foundational concepts in genomics and bioinformatics in-relation to African research priorities.
- Apply advanced practical skills to generate, analyse, and interpret genomic data using accessible tools and workflows.
- Assess and integrate ethical, equitable, and context-specific considerations into genomics research.
- Analyse the potential and limitations of genomics technologies to advance health and scientific discovery.
- Demonstrate leadership, collaboration, and professional reflective practice to support African genomics capacity.
